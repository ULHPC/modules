-----------------------------

bugfix release
- take into account that multiple modules may be extending $MODULEPATH with the same path,
  when determining path to top of module tree (see #1047)

feature + bugfix release
- important changes
    - required Lmod version bumped to v5.6.3 (#944)
        required due to enhancements and bug fixes in Lmod, e.g. making "--terse avail" significantly faster, and
        correctly handling a prepend-path statement that includes multiple directories at once
    - required Tcl/C environment modules version set to 3.2.10 (
        - hard requirement due to fixed modulecmd segmentation fault bug, that only tends manifests itself
          when making a large amount of changes in the environment (e.g. module load <toolchain>)
    - renamed EasyBuildModuleNamingScheme to EasyBuildMNS
- enhanced custom module naming schemes functionality to support hierarchical module naming schemes (#953, #971, #975)
    - extended API for custom module naming schemes to allow tweaking different aspects of module naming

        - an example hierarchical module naming scheme is included, see HierarchicalMNS
    - split up full module names into a module subdirectory part, which becomes part of $MODULEPATH),
      and a 'short' module name (is exposed to end-users)
        - example: 'GCC/4.7.2' in 'Core' subdir, 'OpenMPI/1.6.5' in 'Compiler/GCC/4.7.2' subdir
    - make ModuleNamingScheme class a singleton, move it into easybuild.tools.module_naming_scheme.mns module

    - significant code cleanup & enhanced unit tests
- enhance & clean up tools/modules.py (#944, #953, #963, #964, #969)
    - make ModulesTool a singleton to avoid repeating module commands over & over again needlessly
    - use 'module use', 'module unuse' rather than fiddling with $MODULEPATH directly
    - improve debug logging (include full stdout/stderr output of module commands)
    - remove deprecated functionality (add_module, remove_module, indirect module load)
- various other enhancements, including:
    - added toolchain definitions for 'common' toolchains: 'intel' and 'foss' (#956)

        - tweaking compiler flags triggered by 'optarch' toolchain options using --optarch (#949)
        - filtering out dependencies from easyconfig files using --filter-deps (#957)
        - filtering environment included in test reports with --test-report-env-filter (#959)
            e.g. --test-report-env-filter='^SSH|USER|HOSTNAME|UID|.*COOKIE.*'

v1.13.0 (May 29th 2014)
-----------------------

feature + bugfix release
- make --try-X command line options work recursively (i.e. collaborate with --robot) (#922)
    - EasyBuild will first build a full dependency graph of the specified easyconfigs, and then apply the --try specifications
        - the elements of the dependency graph for the used toolchain and its dependencies are left untouched
    - this makes "eb foo-1.0-goolf-1.4.10.eb --try-toolchain=ictce,5.5.0 --robot" also work when 'foo' has dependencies
    - caveat: the specified easyconfig files must all use the same toolchain (version)
- add support for testing easyconfig pull requests from EasyBuild command line (#920, #924, #925, #932, #933, #938)
    - add --from-pr command line option for downloading easyconfig files from pull requests
    - add --upload-test-report command line option for uploading a detailed test report to GitHub as a gist
        - this requires specifying a GitHub username for which a GitHub token is available, using --github-user
        - with --dump-test-report, the test report can simply be dumped to file rather than being uploaded to GitHub
        - see also https://github.com/hpcugent/easybuild/wiki/Review-process-for-contributions#testing-result
- the 'makeopts' and 'premakeopts' easyconfig parameter are deprecated, and replaced by 'buildopts' and 'prebuildopts' (#918)
    - both 'makeopts' and 'premakeopts' will still be honored in future EasyBuild v1.x versions, but should no longer be used
- various other enhancements, including:
    - add --disable-cleanup-builddir command line option, to keep the build dir after a (successful) build (#853)
        - the build dir is still cleaned up by default for successful builds, i.e. --cleanup-builddir is the default
    - also consider lib32 in paths checked for $LD_LIBRARY_PATH and $LIBRARY_PATH (#912)
    - reorganize support for file/git/svn repositories into 'repository' package, making it extensible (#913)
    - add support for 'postinstallcmds' easyconfig parameter, to specify commands that need to be run after the install step (#918)
    - make 'VERSION=' part in version of C environment modules tool optional, which is required for older versions (#930)
- various bug fixes, including:
    - fix small issues in bootstrap script: correctly determine EasyBuild version and make sure modules path exists (#915)
    - fix github unit tests (#916)
    - disable useless debug logging for unit tests (#919)
    - fix unit test for --skip (#929)
    - make sure 'start_dir' can be set based on location of unpacked first source file (#931)
    - the 'vsc' package shipped with easybuild-framework is synced with vsc-base v1.9.1 (#935)
        - fancylogger (used for logging in EasyBuild) is now robust against strings containing UTF8 characters
        - the 'deprecated' logging function now does a non-strict version check (rather than an erroneous strict check)
        - the easybuild.tools.agithub module is removed, vsc.utils.rest now provides the required functionality
    - fix support for unpacking gzipped source files, don't unpack .gz files in-place in the source directory (#936)

v1.12.1 (April 25th 2014)

    - added support to run_cmd_qa function to supply a list of answers  (#887)
    - detect mismatch between definition of 'module' function and selected modules tool (#871)
        - allowing mismatch now requires --allow-modules-tool-mismatch; an empty 'module' function is simply ignored
    - provide lib64 fallback option for directories in default sanity check paths (#896)
    - add support for adding JAR files to $CLASSPATH (#898)
    - enhanced and cleaned up unit tests (#877, #880, #884, #899, #901)

---------------------------

feature + bugfix release
- add support for Tcl environment modules (modulecmd.tcl) (#728, #729, #739)
    - special care was taken to make sure also the DEISA variant of modulecmd.tcl can be used
- code refactoring to prepare for supporting two formats for easyconfig files (#693, #750)
    - this prepares the codebase for supporting easyconfig format v2.0
    - some initial work on adding support for the new easyconfig format is included, but it's by no means complete yet
    - the current easyconfig format (now dubbed v1.0) is still the default and only supported format, for now
    - for more details, see https://github.com/hpcugent/easybuild/wiki/Easyconfig-format-two
- various other enhancements, including:
    - include a full version of vsc-base (see the 'vsc' subdirectory) (#740)
        - this is a first step towards switching to using vsc-base as a proper dependency

v1.8.2 (October 18th 2013)
--------------------------

bugfix release
- fix regular expression used for obtaining list of modules from 'module avail' (#724)
    - modules marked as default were being hidden from EasyBuild, causing problems when they are used as dependency

v1.8.1 (October 14th 2013)
--------------------------

bugfix release
- various bug fixes, including:
    - fix bugs in regtest procedure (#713)
        - force 2nd and 3rd attempt of build in case 1st attempt failed
    - fix copying of install log to install directory (#716)
    - only create first source path if multiple paths are specified (#718)
    - detect failed PBS job submission by checking obtained job ID for None value (#713, #717, #719, #720)

v1.8.0 (October 4th 2013)
-------------------------

feature + bugfix release
- add support for using alternative module naming schemes (#679, #696, #705, #706, #707)
    - see https://github.com/hpcugent/easybuild/wiki/Using-a-custom-module-naming-scheme for documentation
    - module naming scheme classes that derive from the 'abstract' ModuleNamingScheme class can be provided to EasyBuild
        - the Python module providing the class must be available in the easybuild.tools.module_naming_scheme namespace
        - a function named 'det_full_module_name' must be implemented, that determines the module name
          in the form of an string based on the supplied dictionary(-like) argument
    - the active module naming scheme is determined by EasyBuild configuration option 'module_naming_scheme'
    - for now, only the name/version/versionsuffix/toolchain easyconfig parameters are guaranteed to be provided
        - consistently providing all easyconfig parameters (i.e., also for dependencies) requires more work (see #687)
    - implementing this involved a number of intrusive changes:
        - the API of the modules.py module needed to be changed, breaking backward compatibility
            - the function for which the signatures were modified are considered to be internal to the framework,
              so this should have very minor impact w.r.t. easyblocks not included with EasyBuild
            - affected functions include: available, exists, show, modulefile_path, dependencies_for
        - the format for specifying dependencies was extended, to allow for specifying a custom toolchain
            - this allows to fix inaccurate dependency specifications,
              like "('OpenMPI', '1.6.4-GCC-4.7.2')" to "('OpenMPI', '1.6.4', '', ('GCC', '4.7.2'))"
            - see also https://github.com/hpcugent/easybuild-easyconfigs/pull/431
        - the recommended version for Lmod was bumped to v5.1.5
            - using earlier 5.x version still works, but may be very slow when 'available' is used,
              due to bugs and a missing feature in Lmod versions prior to v5.1.5 on which we rely
- various other enhancements, including:
    - only (try to) change group id if it is different from what is wanted (#685)
    - added toy build unit test (#688)
    - support for specifying a list of source paths in EasyBuild configuration (#690, #702)
    - add function to determine CPU clock speed in systemtools.py (#694, #699)
- various bug fixes, including:
    - avoid importing toolchain modules over and over again to make toolchain constants available in toolchain module (#679)
    - only change the group id if current gid is different from what we want in adjust_permissions function (#685)
    - restore original environment after running 'module purge' (#698)
        - important sidenote: this results in resetting the entire environment, and has impact on the sanity check step;
          any environment variables that are set before the EasyBlock.sanity_check_step method fires, are no longer there
          when the sanity check commands are run (cfr. https://github.com/hpcugent/easybuild-easyblocks/pull/268)

    - add 'unwanted_env_vars' easyconfig parameter to list environment variables to unset during install procedure (#673)
    - add support for updating list easyconfig values (next to string values) (#676)
    - add --dry-run command line option which prints installation overview for specified easyconfig files (#677)
- various bug fixes, including:
    - ensure that all extensions are listed in $EBEXTSLISTX set by module, also when using --skip (#671)
    - report reason for failed sanity check for extensions (#672, #678)
    - fix --list-toolchains command line option (#675)
