To keep each other up-to-date with recent developments and ongoing efforts, we schedule an EasyBuild conference call regularly.

**Note: Since this process is still quite new to us, we're still discovering a setup that works out well. Hence, the below is subject to change.**

### Format

EasyBuild conference calls are intended to enable community members to **stay up-to-date with current and future development efforts** (who is working on what, what is the progress, etc.), both by HPC-UGent and others.

**Everybody is free to join in**, be it actively (speaking up, proposing agenda points, ...) or passively (just listening in with video/sound muted).

The conference calls are planned well ahead (see below), and are held **bi-weekly** (i.e., every other week).

The intention is to keep the calls **focused** and **fast-paced**, which is reflected in the fact that the **duration will be limited to 30 minutes**. The main **agenda points** will be available before the start of the meeting, with a small slot reserved for open questions/suggestions.

### Practical

The conference calls are done by means of a **Google Hangout**. We opted for this approach since hangouts are 100% free (as in beer), as opposed to Skype Premium which is required for group calls and screen sharing.

To be able to join the conference calls, you need inform Kenneth Hoste (@boegel), so he can invite you via your Google+ account. 
~~to [**join the EasyBuild community on Google+**](https://plus.google.com/communities/103632287931200436158), which requires a Google+ account.~~

**To join an EasyBuild conference call, let Kenneth Hoste (a.k.a. boegel, kehoste) know you will be joining.** To avoid making the Google Hangout public (which usually results in random people being bored joining in and disrupting the meeting), only people who registered for the conf call will be invited.
~~use the link in `Video calls in this community` box on the [EasyBuild community page](https://plus.google.com/communities/103632287931200436158)** shortly before the start of the conference call.~~

### Planning

EasyBuild conference calls are planned **every first and third Tuesday of the month, at 3pm CET**.

Google+ Hangout URIs will be provided shortly before the conference calls, both via the EasyBuild community on Google+ and via the EasyBuild mailing list.
